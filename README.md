# HighQualityProgramming_Assignment1
This is a simple project like choosing a pet and  let the pet do some activities and checking the status and consition of pet according to the activities that we are doing with the pet.
When we run the program.
The window will show a the first as three options of pets from that we can choose the desired pet we want. Here, in my code I have 4 options like Dog, Cat and Elephant.
Then the next step is naming the pet. Give the pet a desired name.
In the next step it will give a hello along with the name that we have entered.
Next which pops up along with that is the Main Menu.
In the main menu we have 5 options like Feed the pet, Let the pet play, Let the pet take rest, View the current status according to the things we have doneit will show th edetails like Health, Hunger and Happiness of the pet and finally the last option is to exit.
Here, I have the selected to feed the pet and then showed the status.
Then selected the pet ot play and the status of the pet.
The go for resting the pet and the status of the pet according to that.
I have also fixed certain thresholds like if the pet is fed more then it will show a message like it is not hungry anymore, likewise to the other things likewise if we let the pet play more it will get more and more hungry and when it reaches the threshold it will give an output like its hungry, same for when we let the pet rest for more time there is chance for the pet to get depressed so, at this stage also it will leave a message.
Finally i am pressing the EXIT option to exit the loop
There are also warnings like if we have entered a number or option which is not specified, which gives a message like the vlaue is invalid.
